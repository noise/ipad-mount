# Simple iPad Wall Mount

This is a pretty basic OpenSCAD model of a wall mount for an iPad (or other tablet).

Current version sized for an OG iPad Air, see dimensions in the .scad. It should be fairly easy to customize but note there's some decent amount of hacks especially around the screw holes depending on the overall frame thickness.

Included the .3mf for Cura settings - this only fit on my Elegoo Neptune 2 at 45 degrees.
